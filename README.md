# RayTracer
After completing a ray tracing coursework for Foundations of Modelling and Rendering but being forced to develop the code using a template, I decided to follow https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html instead and combine my knowledge from reading this book and my university assignment
I wrote this code relatively quickly in my spare time during the interim period of finishing semester 1 and starting semester 2 of my final year so the code is not my best work and looking back I would like to make some changes. Reading the code it looks like there are a few bugs, however, I was able to produce the image below
